Mr. Tong Wu finished his bachelor degree in the Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2018, and has been working as a research assistant in Dr. Huangâ€™s group after graduation. His current research interest is studying oxygen reduction reaction with DFT calculations.  Besides doing research, he has developed many hobbies such as photography, coffee and graphic design. He became interested in photography at the age of 13 and he had my photographs posted three times on a local newspaper in Guangzhou when I was in high school. Learning photography and design shapes his aesthetics, teach him to be acutely observant in daily life and help him keep passionate towards life and challenge. His dream is to be the best photographer among chemists, and the best chemist among photographers.
