Searching for highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts for the hydrogen
evolution reaction (HER) that function effectively at all pHs is of great
interest to the scientific community, however it is still a grand challenge,
because the HER kinetics of Pt in alkaline solutions are approximately
two to three orders of magnitude lower than that in acidic solution.

Herein, a new class of wrinkled, ultrathin Rh2P nanosheets for enhancing
HER catalysis at all pHs is reported. They exhibit a small overpotential
of 18.3 mV at 10 mA cm−2, low Tafel slope of 61.5 mV dec−1, and good
durability in alkaline media, much better than the commercial Pt/C catalyst.
Density functional theory calculations reveal that the active open-shell effect
from the P-3p band not only promotes Rh-4d for increased proton–electron
charge exchange but also provides excellent p–p overlapping to locate
the O-related species as distributary center, which can benefit the HER
process in alkaline media. It is also demonstrated that the present wrinkled,
ultrathin Rh2P nanosheets are highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts
toward HER in both acid and neutral electrolytes. The present work opens
a new material design for ultrathin 2D metal phosphide nanostructures for
the purpose of boosting HER performance at all pHs.
