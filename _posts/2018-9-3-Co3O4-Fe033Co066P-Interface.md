Designing well-defined nanointerfaces is of prime importance to enhance
the activity of nanoelectrocatalysts for different catalytic reactions.
However, studies on non-noble-metal-interface electrocatalysts with
extremely high activity and superior stability at high current density
still remains a great challenge.

 Herein, a class of Co3O4/Fe0.33Co0.66P
interface nanowires is rationally designed for boosting oxygen evolution
reaction (OER) catalysis at high current density by partial chemical
etching of Co(CO3)0.5(OH)·0.11H2O (Co-CHH) nanowires with Fe(CN)6
3−,
followed by low-temperature phosphorization treatment. The resulting
Co3O4/Fe0.33Co0.66P interface nanowires exhibit very high OER catalytic
performance with an overpotential of only 215 mV at a current density
of 50 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 59.8 mV dec−1 in 1.0 m KOH. In
particular, Co3O4/Fe0.33Co0.66P exhibits an obvious advantage in enhancing
oxygen evolution at high current density by showing an overpotential of
merely 291 mV at 800 mA cm−2, much lower than that of RuO2 (446 mV).
Co3O4/Fe0.33Co0.66P is remarkably stable for the OER with negligible
current loss under overpotentials of 200 and 240 mV for 150 h. Theoretical
calculations reveal that Co3O4/Fe0.33Co0.66P is more favorable for the OER
since the electrochemical catalytic oxygen evolution barrier is optimally
lowered by the active Co- and O-sites from the Co3O4/Fe0.33Co0.66P
interface.
