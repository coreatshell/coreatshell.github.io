Designing highly efficient interface catalysts with new interface-enhancing
mechanisms for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acid solution still remains
a significant challenge. Here, we report a class of stable PtFe-Fe2C Janus-
like nanoparticle (NP) interface catalysts with an unrevealed barrier-free
interface electron-transfer property that greatly boosts ORR catalytic activity
and stability. 

The PtFe-Fe2C Janus-like NPs showed much higher catalytic activity
for ORR than either PtFe or Fe2C NPs in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes.
Density functional theory simulations revealed that a barrier-free interface electron
transfer on the interface of PtFe-Fe2C Janus-like NPs is the main factor in
enhancing ORR activity. This interface electron-transfer property makes them
the most active for ORR among all reported PtFe-based nanocatalysts. We
further demonstrate that this barrier-free interface electron-transfer property
can be readily generalized to other systems, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction
and H2O2 reduction electrocatalysis, to achieve better electrocatalytic
enhancement.
