The rising demand for radiation detection materials in many
applications has led to extensive research on scintillators1â€“3. The
ability of a scintillator to absorb high-energy (kiloelectronvoltscale)
X-ray photons and convert the absorbed energy into lowenergy
visible photons is critical for applications in radiation
exposure monitoring, security inspection, X-ray astronomy and
medical radiography4,5.

However, conventional scintillators are
generally synthesized by crystallization at a high temperature
and their radioluminescence is difficult to tune across the visible
spectrum. Here we describe experimental investigations of a series
of all-inorganic perovskite nanocrystals comprising caesium
and lead atoms and their response to X-ray irradiation. These
nanocrystal scintillators exhibit strong X-ray absorption and
intense radioluminescence at visible wavelengths. Unlike bulk
inorganic scintillators, these perovskite nanomaterials are solutionprocessable
at a relatively low temperature and can generate X-rayinduced
emissions that are easily tunable across the visible spectrum
by tailoring the anionic component of colloidal precursors during
their synthesis. These features allow the fabrication of flexible
and highly sensitive X-ray detectors with a detection limit of
13 nanograys per second, which is about 400 times lower than
typical medical imaging doses. We show that these colour-tunable
perovskite nanocrystal scintillators can provide a convenient
visualization tool for X-ray radiography, as the associated image
can be directly recorded by standard digital cameras. We also
demonstrate their direct integration with commercial flat-panel
imagers and their utility in examining electronic circuit boards
under low-dose X-ray illumination.
