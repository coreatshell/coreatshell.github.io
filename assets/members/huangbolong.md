            Dr. Bolong Huang received Ph.D. in 2012 
            from University of Cambridge, and he obtained 
            B.Sc. in condensed matter physics from Department 
            of Physics, Peking University 2007. Following a 
            systematic training period as research assistant 
            in Chemistry Department in Peking University, and 
            in Hong Kong, he was starting-up his independent 
            research as PI in the Hong Kong Polytechnic 
            University in 2015. His main research fields are 
            DFT calculations on rare earth functional nanomaterials, 
            defect theory of solid functional nanomaterials, 
            DFT calculation development based on abinitio electronic 
            self-energy corrections, and semicore orbital corrections 
            as an implement in time-dependent DFT theory.

## Research Interests

1. Theoretical calculations with exact electronic self-energy corrections on local orbital electrons in rare-earth materials.
2. Electronic structure and regulations of solid state functional materials.
3. Inverse-designing and searching for new generation renewable energy materials for property modulations and rare-earth modification.
